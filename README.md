# Development

If you plan on contributing (thank you!), here's what you should know:

* `npm run start` - Starts the react server. This will *not* open it in the browser
* `npm run electron` - Starts the electron instance
* `npm run pack` - Automatically builds with React as well as with electron.
* `npm run dist`- Builds the executable. You'll find it in `./dist/`
