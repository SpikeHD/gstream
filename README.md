# Usage

Download the lastest release for your platform [here](https://github.com/SpikeHD/gstream/releases/) and run it. After that it should be fairly straight forward.

\**Mac support coming when I buy (or somone buys me 👀) a Mac 😛*

# Goals

- [x] Torrent link downloader
- [ ] Better UI

# Development

If you plan on contributing (thank you!), here's what you should know:

* `npm run start` - Starts the react server. This will *not* open it in the browser
* `npm run electron` - Starts the electron instance
* `npm run pack` - Automatically builds with React as well as with electron.
* `npm run dist`- Builds the executable. You'll find it in `./dist/`
